# Overview
Download thes 3 files and put them into your "LOCAL" folder, where your game is installed.
Only do this if you own the Steam/GOG version. Other versions don't have this bug.

# File information
HALLA.SET
Fixes a script error that appears when entering the A-Deck corridors during TOUR mode. Without this fix, the player would get spammend with error messages, until he leaves the corridor.

VESTSTBD.SET
fixes bug in the door logic. In the regular version, the player would end up on A-Deck promenade when using the door on BOAT Deck in the grand stair case, starboard side.

ESTPORT.SET
Similar bug fix as for VESTSTB.SET, but for the port side. The error here is even more severe, because the player could not just use the gym door closeby.
