# How to install
If you use the Steam or GOG version, choose the files you need from the folders and put them into your "LOCAL" folder, where your game is installed.
If you play the game with another version, it is not that easy. In this case you must create new .ISO images of the CDs and run the game with those.

# Fixes
Have a look in the "fixes" folder if you want to fix a few bugs that are only present in the Steam/GOG version of the game.

Currently available bug fixes:

HALLA.SET -
Fixes a script error that appears when entering the A-Deck corridors during TOUR mode. Without this fix, the player would get spammend with error messages, until he leaves the corridor.

HALLB.SET -
Brings back "Jay". In the CD version he walked up and down the corridors. For some reason he was missing in the Steam/GOG version.

VESTSTBD.SET -
fixes bug in the door logic. In the regular version, the player would end up on A-Deck promenade when using the door on BOAT Deck in the grand stair case, starboard side.

ESTPORT.SET -
Similar bug fix as for VESTSTB.SET, but for the port side. The error here is even more severe, because the player could not just use the gym door closeby.

GSTAIR2.SET -
fixes a bug that caused the character "Trask" to clip though the stairs.

If you download the "FULL"Patch under "Releases" you will also get a bunch of SET files that fixes the bug that made the image blurry when going around the ship.

# Mods
In the "mods" folder you will find modifications that change some of the original content.

Currently available:

LNGHALL.SET - This will unlock the door to the lounge during TOUR mode. You will be able to enter it just normally. Mind that during STORY mode there are no changes! Smethels will still not let you in before the sinking. WARNING: If you don't use the Steam or GOG version, it is not enough to replace the file on CD. You also must make sure that file "LOUNGE1C.SET" is included on BOTH CDs! Ohterwise it won't be able to load the lounge and will output a script error.
