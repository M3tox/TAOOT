# Overview
Here you find modifciations and additions that were not in the original game. If you use the Steam or GOG version you can just put these files into your "LOCAL" folder, where the game is installed. If you want to use these files on other versions, you must create a new custom ISO image file for it!

# Files
LNGHALL.SET
This will unlock the door to the lounge during TOUR mode. You will be able to enter it just normally. Mind that during STORY mode there are no changes! Smethels will still not let you in before the sinking.
WARNING: If you don't use the Steam or GOG version, it is not enough to replace the file on CD. You also must make sure that file "LOUNGE1C.SET" is included on BOTH CDs! Ohterwise it won't be able to load the lounge and will output a script error.
